# Practice: SQL - 2
## Advanced SQL Queries - Joins, Subqueries, Grouping

### Reflection

I learned how to use GROUP BY with aggregate functions like SUM(), as well as the difference between using WHERE and HAVING to filter results. The assignment also taught me how to combine data from related tables using INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN. 

The most challenging aspect was correctly applying the filtering conditions using WHERE versus HAVING. I had to distinguish that WHERE filters individual rows before they are grouped, while HAVING filters the results of the aggregated data. Getting the syntax and logic for combining GROUP BY with JOIN clauses took some practice to ensure the correct columns were selected and aggregated as intended.
